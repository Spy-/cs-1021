## Introduction

This program allows a user to reverse a .wav file or create a .wav file that plays a tone for one second or a .wav that will play a different tone on two channels to create stereo sound.

## Conclusion

Learned how audio files such as .wav work

## Things I Liked / Suggestions for Improvement

I liked how when my program wrote a wav file, it was very obvious if the output is correct because you can just listen to the output
